# Step 2: Running Python code to interact with Intersight

## Run each Intersight REST API request

### Run the GET request for compute/PhysicalSummaries
1. Click the **Run** menu in the IDLE Editor loaded with the `intersight_ops.py` code.
1. Click the **Run Module** option.

1. Because `request_process` was set to `True`, the `GET` request will run. Provided your API keys were setup correctly, you should see output similar to the JSON response example below.

### Run the GET request for ntp/Policies
1. Change the value of `request_process` for the previous `GET` request to `False`.
1. Change the value of `request_process` for this `GET` request to `True`.
1. Change the "Run" menu by clicking the **Run Module** option, then **Save** your code (if prompted).

  The `GET` request should return `"Results" : null` as no NTP policies have been created yet.

### Run the POST request for ntp/Policies
1. Change the value of `request_process` for the previous `GET` request to `False`.
1. Change the value of `request_process` for this `POST` request to `True`.
1. In the **Run** menu, click the **Run Module** option and **Save** your code (if prompted).

   The **POST** request creates the NTP Policy named `ntp-policy` defined by the JSON in `request_body`

1. View this new NTP Policy in Intersight by navigating to **Policies-->Server Policies** and clicking on the `ntp-policy` policy name.

### Run two POST requests to create two additional NTP Policies

Next run two post commands to create `ntp-policy-east` and `ntp-policy-west`.

1. Change the value of `request_process` for the previous `POST` request to `False`.
1. Change the value of `request_process` for the two NTP Policies `POST` requests to `True`
1. Select the **Run Module** option from the **Run** menu and **Save** your code (if prompted). 

   ![](assets/images/image-16.jpg)<br/><br/>

1. The `POST` requests create two additional NTP Policies.
1. View the additional NTP Policies in Intersight.

### Run the PATCH request for ntp/Policies
1. Change the value of `request_process` for the previous two `POST` requests to `False`.
1. Change the value of `request_process` for this `PATCH` request to `True`.
1. Click the the **Run Module** option from the **Run** menu and **Save** your code (if prompted). 

   ![](assets/images/image-17.jpg)<br/><br/>

1. The `PATCH` request updates the `ntp-policy` as defined by the JSON `request_body`. The `Moid` in the response is the `Moid` of the `ntp-policy`.

   ![](assets/images/image-18.jpg)<br/><br/>

1. The `PATCH` process first runs a `GET` request to retrieve the object for an NTP Policy named `ntp-policy`. This is done by building a `$filter` query on the request URL: `https://www.intersight.com/api/v1/npt/Policies?$filter=Name eq 'ntp-policy'`. (The [Intersight API Guide](https://intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/query/) has extensive documentation on queries and the formatting of queries.)
1. View the updated NTP Policy in Intersight and note there are now two NTP Servers shown for the Policy.

### Run the DELETE request for ntp/Policies
1. Change the value of `request_process` for the previous `PATCH` request to `False`.
1. Change the value of `request_process` for this **DELETE** request to `True`
1. Click the the **Run Module** option from the **Run** menu and **Save** your code (if prompted). 
1. The **DELETE** process in the Python code first runs a `GET` request to retrieve the object for `ntp-policy-east`. This is done by building a `$filter` query on the request URL: `https://www.intersight.com/api/v1/npt/Policies?$filter=Name eq 'ntp-policy-east'`

   ![](assets/images/image-20.jpg)<br/><br/>

1. The `DELETE` request deletes `ntp-policy-east`. There is no response text, only the response code. The response `<Response [200]>` indicates a successful delete operation.

1. View the NTP Policies in Intersight and note `ntp-policy-east` has been deleted.
