# Step 2: Use a Postman collection to interact with Intersight

## Create an Intersight environment in Postman
We're almost reaady to use the imported Intersight REST API Postman collection. To make Intersight REST API calls via Postman, you'll need to create a *Postman Environment* and populate two environment variables.

### Create a Postman environment for Intersight
1. Click the **Eye** icon in the upper-right of the Postman interface.
1. Click **Add** in the upper-right of the **Environment** section.
1. Enter `Intersight` in the **Environment Name** field.

### Create Environment Variables for your REST API Keys

1. Enter the variable name `api-key-id` in the **VARIABLE** field.
1. Enter your API key ID in the **INITIAL VALUE** field. The API key ID is found under **Settings-->API Keys** in the Intersight interface.
1. Enter the variable name `secret-key` in the **VARIABLE** field.
1. Enter the entire contents of the `SecretKey.txt` file in the **INITIAL VALUE** field. The `SecretKey.txt` file is located in the `C:\Users\administrator\Downloads` directory. This file was downloaded when you created the API keys in Intersight.
1. CLick the **Add** button to create and save the environment.

1. CLick the **X** in the upper-right of the **MANAGE ENVIRONMENTS** dialog.

### View the Intersight REST API Environment and open the Postman console

1. Select the Intersight environment by clicking the **No Environment** drop-down in the upper-right and selecting the **Intersight** environment.

2. View the Intersight environment variables by clicking the **Eye** icon in the upper-right.

   All of the Intersight requests send output to the Postman Console.

3. Open the Postman console by clicking clicking **Show Postman Console** from the **View** menu.

With the Intersight Postman environment created and the Postman console open you can now run the Intersight REST API requests and view call results.

### Intersight REST API Requests

##### Make GET Requests
1. Click the **GET** request labeled `GET Compute / PhysicalSummaries`. Note the request URI: `https://intersight.com/api/v1/compute/PhysicalSummaries`. This `GET` request queries the `compute/PhysicalSummaries` Intersight resource. The response is a JSON list of every Intersight-managed compute resource in your account.
1. Click **SEND"**. 
1. View the results in the Postman interface and console. You can scroll through the results and view the `Moid` Managed Object ID for each compute resource. As well you can view a variety of attributes for each compute resource in your account.

   The Postman console was populated by both the Collection tests and the `GET` request tests. View the JavaScript in the tests to see how the individual resource attributes were accessed.

1. Click the `GET NTP Policies` `GET` request. This rquest queries the `ntp/Policies` Intersight resource. The response is a JSON listing of every Intersight-managed NTP Policy resource in your account. Note the `https://intersight.com/api/v1/ntp/Policies` request URI.
1. Click **SEND**. This query retrieves a JSON encoded list of all the NTP Policies in your Intersight account, if any. If there are no NTP Policies, the JSON response is a null "Results" list.

   Also be sure to look at the Collection tests run as part of the `GET` request.

#### Make a POST Request
Run the `POST` request for POST NTP Policy. The `POST` URI used is the same as the `GET` URI for NTP Policies. However, because it is a `POST` request, a new NTP Policy will be created if an NTP Policy of the same name does not already exist. The body of the POST request describes the new NTP Policy. 

1. Click the **POST NTP Policy** `POST` request. Note the request URI: `https://intersight.com/api/v1/ntp/Policies`.
1. Click **SEND**. The new NTP Policy named `ntp-policy` is created in your Intersight account. A JSON NTP Policy Managed Object is returned in the POST request response.

1. To view the new NTP Policy in Intersight, navigate to **Policies-->Server Policies** and click on the `ntp-policy`.

#### Make a PATCH Request
Run the `PATCH` request for UPDATE NTP Policy. The `PATCH` URI has a Postman variable appended to the end of the URI. The variable `{{ntp-policy}}` was set by "tests" in the `POST` request that created the NTP Policy. That `{{ntp-policy}}` was sent to the `Moid` of the created NTP Policy. The `Moid` is appended to the end of the URI to indicate the URI the **PATCH** request updates. The Pre-request script in the Postman Collection is responsible for updating the **PATCH** Uri with the `Moid` stored in the `{{ntp-policy}}` variable. The Body of the PATCH request describes the updates to be made to the NTP Policy with the specified `Moid`.

1. Click the `UPDATE NTP Policy` `PATCH` request. Note the request URI: `https://intersight.com/api/v1/ntp/Policies/{{ntp-policy}}`.
1. Click **SEND**. The existing NTP Policy named `ntp-policy` has been updated in your Intersight account. A JSON NTP Policy Managed Object is returned in the PATCH request response.

1. To view the updated NTP Policy in Intersight, navigate to **Policies-->Server Policies** and click on the `ntp-policy`.

#### Make a DELETE Request
1. Run the DELETE request to DELETE the NTP Policy

  - ***Click*** the **DELETE** request labeled `DELETE NTP Policy`<br/><br/>

  Notice the request Uri

  - `https://intersight.com/api/v1/ntp/Policies/{{ntp-policy}}`<br/><br/>

  The **DELETE** Uri is the same at the **PATCH** it has the Postman variable `{{ntp-policy}}` appended to the end.

  The Pre-request script in the Postman Collection is responsible for updating the **DELETE** Uri with the `Moid` stored in the `{{ntp-policy}}` variable.

  There is no Body for the DELETE request.

  - ***Click*** the "SEND" button<br/><br/>

  The existing NTP Policy named ntp-policy has been deleted from your Intersight account. The only indication the the request was successful is the `200OK` status code.

  To verify that the NTP Policy named `ntp-policy` is no longer in Intersight

  - ***Navigate*** to "Policies-->Server Policies"<br/><br/>

  ![](assets/images/image-28.jpg)<br/><br/>

You have run through all the HTTP Method operations available via the Intersight REST API that allow you to Query, Create, Update and Delete Intersight Managed Objects. There are many Policies available in Intersight, with new capabilities being adde regularly.
