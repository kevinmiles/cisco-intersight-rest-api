# Introduction to the Cisco Intersight REST API with Postman

This Introduction to the Cisco Intersight REST API with Postman Learning Lab will guide you through the use of Cisco Intersight REST APIs with Postman to perform Queries, Updates and Configuration with Cisco Intersight.

## Objectives

After completing this lab you will know:

  - How to Create a Cisco Intersight Account
  - How to Claim UCS Devices in Cisco Intersight
  - How to Create Cisco Intersight API Keys
  - How to a Use a Postman Collection to interact with Cisco Intersight REST APIs

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab, it would be helpful to understand Cisco Intersight functionality.

An understanding of REST, JSON and a bit of JavaScript would also be helpful.

## Cisco Intersight REST API Documentation
Documentation for Cisco Intersight REST API is available at  [intersight.com](https://intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/overview/).

### Learning Lab Infrastructure Requirements
All the exercises in the Introduction to the Cisco Intersight REST API with Postman Learning Lab can be completed using the [Cisco Intersight Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/a63216d2-e891-4856-9f27-309ca61ec862?diagramType=Topology).

# Step 1: Claim a UCS Device in Cisco Intersight

### Create Cisco Intersight API Keys

Cisco Intersight **API Keys** are a two part Key an *API Key ID* and a *Secret Key*. The API Key ID is a multi-character string that is always visible to you after initial key creation. The Secret Key is an **RSA Private Key** that is only available at API Key creation.

1. Create Cisco Intersight API Keys, in Intersight

  - ***Click*** the "Settings" icon
  - ***Click*** "API Keys" in the left-hand navigation
  - ***Click*** the "Generate API Key" button
  - ***Enter*** a Description for the Key
  - ***Click*** the "Generate" button
  - ***Click*** the "Save Secret Key to text file" icon

  A file named "SecretKey.txt" will be downloaded to your default downloads location for your browser. In the DevNet Intersight Sandbox, the file will be downloaded to `C:\Users\administrator\Downloads\SecretKey.txt`

Next Step: Importing a Postman Collection to Interact with Cisco Intersight.
