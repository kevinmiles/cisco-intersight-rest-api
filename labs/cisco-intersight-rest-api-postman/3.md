# Step 3: Use a Postman Collection to Interact with Cisco Intersight

### Create an Intersight Environment in Postman
The imported Intersight REST API Postman Collection is almost ready to be used.  You'll need to create a **Postman Environment** and populate two environment variables in order to make Intersight REST API calls via Postman.

1. Create a Postman Environment for Intersight

  - ***Click*** the "Eye" icon in the upper-right of the Postman interface.
  - ***Click*** "Add" in the upper-right of the "Environment" section.
  - ***Enter*** "Intersight" in the "Environment Name" field

2. Create Environment Variables for your REST API Keys

  - ***Enter*** the variable name `api-key-id` in the "VARIABLE" field.
  - ***Enter*** your **API Key ID** in the "INITIAL VALUE" field.

  The API Key ID is found under "Settings-->API Keys" in the Intersight interface.

  - ***Enter*** the variable name `secret-key` in the "VARIABLE" field.
  - ***Enter*** the entire contents of the `SecretKey.txt` file in the "INITIAL VALUE" field.

  The `SecretKey.txt` file is located in the directory `C:\Users\administrator\Downloads`. This file was downloaded when you created the API Keys in Intersight.

  - ***Click*** the "Add" button to create and save the environment.

  - ***Click*** the "X" in the upper-right of the "MANAGE ENVIRONMENTS" dialog.

### View the Intersight REST API Environment and open the Postman Console.

1. Select the Intersight Environment

  - ***Click*** the drop-down in the upper-right with the text "No Environment"
  - ***Select*** the "Intersight" environment

2. View the Intersight Environment variables

  - ***Click*** the "Eye" icon in the upper-right.

All of the Intersight requests with output to the Postman Console.

3. Open the Postman console

  - ***Click*** the "View" menu
  - ***Click*** the "Show Postman Console" menu item

    ![](assets/images/image-31.jpg)<br/><br/>

With the Intersight Postman Environment created and Postman Console open you can now run the Intersight REST API requests and view results of the REST API calls.

### Make Intersight REST API Requests
1. Make the GET request for GET Compute / PhysicalSummaries

  - ***Click*** the **GET** request labeled `GET Compute / PhysicalSummaries`

  Notice the request Uri

  - `https://intersight.com/api/v1/compute/PhysicalSummaries`

  The **GET** is a query of the `compute/PhysicalSummaries` Intersight resource. The response is a JSON encoded listing of every Intersight managed compute resource in your account.

  - ***Click*** the "SEND" button

2. View the results in the Postman Interface and the Postman Console.

  - You can scroll through the results and view the `Moid` Managed Object ID for each compute resource. As well you can view a variety of attributes for each compute resource in your account.

  - The Postman Console was populated by both the Collect "Tests" and the GET request "Tests". View the JavaScript in the "Tests" to see how the individual resource attributes were accessed.
