# Step 2: Explore the Intersight Developer Tools

## Intersight REST API Developer Tools

1. View the Intersight REST API Documentation at [https://www.intersight.com/apidocs](https://www.intersight.com/apidocs). The Intersight REST API guide documents all technical aspects, from supported HTTP methods to FAQs. Be sure to take a look at the sections to familiarize yourself with each section's content.

1. View the API Reference by clicking the **API Reference** heading in the top navigation. When logged into Intersight, the API Reference is an active REST client that can work with objects in your Intersight account.

1. Scroll the left-hand resource group navigation to **compute/PhysicalSummary** and click the **compute/PhysicalSummary** title to expand the section. When the resource group title is clicked, the right-side panel is populated with the **Model Schema** for an object of the selected resource. The **Model Schema** describes the structure and attributes the object

## Use the REST client in the API Reference to access objects in your Intersight account

1. Click the first **GET** request listed under **compute/PhysicalSummary**.
1. If the **REST client** slider in the upper-right of the **GET** request description is not already green (i.e. activated), slide it until it turns green.
1. Click **SEND** in the REST client. The **GET** request `Response Text` is displayed.

   All the attributes of all the objects in the `compute/PhysicalSummaries` resource group are displayed.

## Use the REST client in the API Reference to access specific object attributes

1. Using the same `GET*` request add "Query Parameters" to limit the returned object attributes to:

    - **Dn** (Distinguished Name)
    - **AvailableMemory**
    - **NumCpus**

1. Click **+ Query Parameter**.
1. Enter `$select` in the **Key** field.
1. Enter `Dn,AvailableMemory,NumCpus` in the **Value** field.
1. Click **SEND**. The response text showing only the specified attributes appears.
