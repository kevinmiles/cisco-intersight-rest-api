# Step 2: Explore the Cisco Intersight Developer Tools

## Cisco Intersight REST API Developer Tools

1. View the Intersight REST API Documentation at [https://www.intersight.com/apidocs](https://www.intersight.com/apidocs). The Intersight REST API guide documents all technical aspects, from supported HTTP methods to FAQs. Be sure to take a look at the sections to familiarize yourself with each section's content.

1. View the API Reference by clicking the **API Reference** heading in the top navigation. When you are logged in to Intersight, the API Reference is an active REST Client that can work with objects in your Intersight account.

1. Scroll the left-hand resource group navigation to **compute/PhysicalSummary** and click the **compute/PhysicalSummary** title to expand the section. When the resource group title is clicked, the right-side panel is populated with the "Model Schema" for an object of the selected resource. The "Model Schema" describes the structure and attributes the object

## Use the REST Client in the API Reference to access objects in your Intersight account

1. Click the first **GET** request listed under **compute/PhysicalSummary**.
1. If the **REST Client** slider in the upper-right of the **GET** request description is not already green (i.e. activated), slide it until it turns green.
1. Click **SEND** in the REST Client. The **GET** request `Response Text` is displayed.

   All the attributes of all the objects in the `compute/PhysicalSummaries` resource group are displayed.

## Use the REST Client in the API Reference to access specific object attributes

1. Using the same **GET** request add "Query Parameters" to limit the returned object attributes to:

    - Dn
    - AvailableMemory
    - NumCpus

1. Click **+ Query Parameter**.
1. Enter `$select` in the **Key** field.
1. Enter `Dn,AvailableMemory,NumCpus` in the **Value** field.
1. Click **SEND**. The response text showing only the specified attributes appears.
