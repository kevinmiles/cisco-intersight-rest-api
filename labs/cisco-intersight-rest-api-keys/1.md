## Intersight REST API Documentation
Documentation for Cisco Intersight REST API is available at  [intersight.com](https://intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/overview/).

### Learning Lab infrastructure requirements
All the exercises in the Introduction to the Cisco Intersight REST API Learning Lab can be completed using the [Cisco Intersight Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/a63216d2-e891-4856-9f27-309ca61ec862?diagramType=Topology).

### Create Cisco Intersight API Keys

Cisco Intersight **API Keys** are a two part Key; an *API Key ID* and a *Secret Key*. The API Key ID is a multi-character string that is always visible to you after initial key creation. The Secret Key is an **RSA Private Key** that is only available at API Key creation.

1. Create Cisco Intersight API Keys, in Intersight

  - ***Click*** the "Settings" icon
  - ***Click*** "API Keys" in the left-hand navigation
  - ***Click*** the "Generate API Key" button
  - ***Enter*** a Description for the Key
  - ***Click*** the "Generate" button
  - ***Click*** the "Save Secret Key to text file" icon

    ![](assets/images/image-12.jpg)<br/><br/>
    ![](assets/images/image-13.jpg)<br/><br/>

  A file named "SecretKey.txt" will be downloaded to your default downloads location for your browser. In the DevNet Intersight Sandbox, the file will be downloaded to `C:\Users\administrator\Downloads\SecretKey.txt`

### Activate the Cisco Intersight Essentials License Evaluation

Cisco Intersight currently has two editions of functionality, **Base** and **Essentials**. The Cisco Intersight REST API Learning Labs require features of the **Essentials** edition.

- Base Features

    - Supports Cisco UCS and HyperFlex Systems
    - Global inventory and health status
    - Tagging and basic global search
    - Context-launch of element managers
    - Cisco HyperFlex installation
    - User customizable dashboard
    - Automated collection of tech support files for UCS Systems

- Essentials Features

    - All functionality of Base
    - Cisco UCS C-Series management
    - Policy-based configuration through Service Profiles
    - Detailed inventory and server actions
    - Firmware Management
    - Virtual Keyboard-Video-Mouse (vKVM)
    - Server HCL compliance check

New features are continually being added to both editions.

You must activate the **Essentials** edition to complete the Cisco Intersight Learning Labs as they use the Cisco Intersight REST API to perform actions that are part of the **Essentials** edition. If you already are in an evaluation period for your Intersight account or have an **Essentials** license you can skip this step.

1. Activate the **Essentials** Evaluation License.

  - ***Navigate*** to "Settings-->License"
  - ***Click*** the "Start Evaluation" button under the **Essentials** "Feature" list
  - ***Click*** the "Start" button on the "Start Evaluation 90 Days" dialog<br/><br/>

  The **Essentials** license is now active.
